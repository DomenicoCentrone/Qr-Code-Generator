# QR Code Generator
[DEMO](https://ubiquitous-phoenix-f5eeda.netlify.app/)
This project is a simple QR Code generator built with Node.js. It uses the `inquirer` package for command line user inputs and the `qr-image` package for generating QR codes.

## Features

- Prompt the user to enter a URL.
- Generate a QR code based on the input URL.
- Save the generated QR code as a PNG image.
- Save the input URL to a text file.

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install inquirer qr-image fs
```

...

## Usage

1. **Running the Script**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:
    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```
2. **Entering URL**: Follow the on-screen prompt and enter the URL for which you want to generate the QR code.
3. **Output**: After entering the URL, the script will generate a QR code and save it as `qr_image.png` in the project directory. Additionally, the entered URL will be saved in a text file named `url.txt`.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary Node.js packages installed by running `npm install` before executing the script.

Follow the on-screen prompt and enter the URL for which you want to generate the QR code. The QR code will be saved as `qr_image.png` in the project directory, and the URL will be saved in a text file named `url.txt`.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the execution, the error will be logged to the console. If the prompt couldn't be rendered, it might be due to the current environment not supporting TTY.
